Class: Thought\n    - Purpose: To interact with a Prolog knowledge base and manage its state.\n\n2. Constructor: __init__(self, queue, state, model_name)\n    - Purpose: Initializes the Thought instance with a queue for messages, a state representing the Prolog knowledge base's dynamic variables, and a model name for the ThinkGPT instance.\n\n3. Method: teach(self, prolog_syntax)\n    - Purpose: Teaches the Thought instance Prolog query syntax.\n\n4. Method: get_state(self)\n    - Purpose: Returns the current state of the Thought instance.\n\n5. Method: set_state(self, updated_state)\n    - Purpose: Updates the state of the Thought instance.\n\n6. Method: get_query(self)\n    - Purpose: Returns the query string composed by the Thought instance.\n\n7. Method: set_reply(self, reply)\n    - Purpose: Sets the reply from the Prolog knowledge base to the Thought's query.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\nthought.py\n```python\nimport json\nfrom thinkgpt import ThinkGPT\n\nclass Thought:\n    def __init__(self, queue, state, model_name):\n        self.queue = queue\n        self.state = json.loads(state)\n        self.llm = ThinkGPT(model_name)\n        self.query = \"\"\n        self.reply = {}\n\n    def teach(self, prolog_syntax):\n        # Teach the Thought instance Prolog query syntax\n        self.query = prolog_syntax\n\n    def get_state(self):\n        # Return the current state of the Thought instance\n        return json.dumps(self.state)\n\n    def set_state(self, updated_state):\n        # Update the state of the Thought instance\n        self.state = json.loads(updated_state)\n\n    def get_query(self):\n        # Return the query string composed by the Thought instance\n        return self.query\n\n    def set_reply(self, reply):\n        # Set the reply from the Prolog knowledge base to the Thought's query\n        self.reply = json.loads(reply)\n```\n\nrequirements.txt\n```txt\njson\nthinkgpt\n```\n\nPlease note that the ThinkGPT library is assumed to be a Python package that provides a class ThinkGPT.
